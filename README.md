# Credit Risk Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger is likely to survive or not using logistic regression. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow including data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Passenger class
- Fare
- Family size
- Embarkation port

Target variable:
- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Machine Learning Model
Model used:
- Logistic Regression

Steps performed:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Model training
- Prediction
- Model evaluation

## Results

Accuracy achieved:
80.45%

Confusion Matrix:
- True Negatives: 98
- False Positives: 12
- False Negatives: 23
- True Positives: 46
